title: "0.22.0"
category: New Release
---
  - Merge branch 'feature/mask_spectral_regions' into develop

  - Bug fix: the mask regions were not correctly read by Beagle, and so they were ignored

  - Correctly using the 'beagleCollector' class

  - Using the new 'ConfigurationClass' and parameter file checking to identify inconsistencies between the Beagle version and the entries in the parameter file used

  - Adding routine that checks whether the parameter file contains entries which are not recognized by Beagle. This is especially useful to identify parameter file entries which are not supported anymore because the code has evolved

  - Updating astrofortran dependency to fix bug

  - Replaced 'read_line' --> 'read_config_line' and 'read_value' --> 'read_config_value' to exploit the possibility of checking whether a parameter file contains unknown entries

  - Updated astrofortran version to be able to use the new 'read_config_line' and 'read_config_value' routines

  - Using the refactored observed-frame and rest-frame spectroscopic masks, also ensuring that the mask printed in the output file corresponds to the mask used in the likelihood computation, as this was not the case before

  - Added new attributes to the 'spectrum_description' type to support oberved- and rest-frame masks

  - Removed support for parameter file entry 'MASK OBSERVATION REGIONS'; added support for entries 'MASK OBSERVED-FRAME REGIONS' and 'MASK REST-FRAME REGIONS'

  - Added possibility to pass a redshift to mask wl regions both in the observed- and rest-frame. By default the routine assume that the input wl and the mask regions are in the same frame, providing a redshift will redshift the mask regions.

  - Moving the 'spectrum_description' data type into the 'ClassCollector' type

  - Removed support for parameter file entry 'MASK TEMPLATE REGIONS'

  - Updating astrofortran version to use the new class 'ConfigurationClass'

  - Using 'SPEC_FILENAME_SEPARATOR' delimiter
