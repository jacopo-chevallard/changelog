title: "0.3.2"
category: New Release
---
- Now the code behaves correctly when *.ised files are not read along the *.ineb ones: this will leave some quantities (that need the *.ised files to be computed) undefined
- Setting the fluxes to 0.0 fixes #75, #98, jacopo-chevallard/BEAGLE-general#9, while inserting the optional reading of the *ised files along the *ineb ones fixes #96 and again #75
- Added flag to check the reading of *.ised files when reading the *.ineb ones
