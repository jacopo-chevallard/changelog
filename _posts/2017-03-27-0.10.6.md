title: "0.10.6"
category: New Release
---
- Added computation of number of HeI and HeII ionizing photons, which are also printed in the output file, closes #162
- Version bump 0.10.4-dev, waiting for feedback from issue #156 before bumping to 0.10.4
- Added new module to print extended information in the FITS tables headers; added information on spectral indices definition to SPECTRAL INDICES extenstion
- Added units to FITS table
- Removed automatic calculation of lines EWs. The output now includes intrinsic and observed line luminosities, instead of observed luminosities and EWs.
- Splitted the spectral index description from the spectral index catalogue, to allow indices to be computed even when creating a mock catalogue (this modifications make the bahaviour of the spectral indices types more similar to that of photometry types)
- Added comments
