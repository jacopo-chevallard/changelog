title: "0.8.0"
category: New Release

- Version bump 0.8.0
- Version bump 0.8.0-rc.1
- Multiple changes, to deal with issue #141: the idea is that when the user adopts a single SF period and hence uses the 'mass' parameter, then the 'mass' refers to the entire stellar mass assembled, including the mass formed in the last 'current_sfr_timescale' yr. Before this modifications, 'mass' referred to the stelar mass assembled unitl the last 'current_sfr_timescale'.
- Changed name of 'mass' parameter for SFH described by multiple periods. The mass formed in each SF period is now parametrized by the 'mass_bin' parameter, while the 'mass' parameter only refers to single-period SFH
- Removed some files
- Added Bessel V and U curves
- Improved computation of equivalent width of lines, following the definition of Worthey+94 and Trager+98, closes #44
- Added flag to check if the loaded spectral index (line EW or line luminosity) is valid, i.e. it has positive errors
- Added checks to ensure that the function that converts ssfr and mass into sfr is bracketed by the adopted values for the minimum and maximum log(sfr)
- Simplified API of the function 'print_posterior_probability'
- Removed some Python scripts which are now part of your 'home/bin' repository
- Edits to make routines compatible with the new API of the 'integrated_spectrum' and 'mean_integrated_spectrum' functions
- Added ability to compute integral of SED within arbitrary limits, hence changed the API of the 'integrated_spectrum' and 'mean_integrated_spectrum' functions
- Added calls to plotting routines, which can be uncommented to speed up debugging
