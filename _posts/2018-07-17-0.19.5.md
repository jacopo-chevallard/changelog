  - Checkign whether the LSF is set, not just initialized, before applying it

  - Bug fix: the LSF was applied to the model spectrum also dividing by the width of the spectral bins, causing a wrong normalization of the speectrum; Legendre polynomial are now used instead of normal polynomials to describe the variation of the LSF width and center with lambda; added the 'lsf_units' parameter to define whether the LSF is epxressed as a FWHM or as sigma

  - Bug fix: the 'bin_number' extracted from the parameter names (e.g. param_name-1) included the '-' character, which was interpreted as a minus sign when covnerting it into an index; 'lsf_type' is now set, along with 'lsf_units', in the 'initialize_lsf_parameters' procedure

  - Renamed 'sigma' --> 'width', since the width of the LSF can be expressed in both km/s (sigma) and angstrom (FWHM); added 'units' field to the 'lsf_data' data type

  - Updated astrofortran dependency, needed to access the 'legendre_poly' function
