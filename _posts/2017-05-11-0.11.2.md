category: New Release

- Improved the way we deal with creation of mock SEDs: unphysical combinations of parameters are now excluded from the output FITS file, without having repetitions of ok combinations of parameters; we now attempt to draw mutliple times 'random' mock parameters in combination with 'grid' parameters so as to obtain physical combinations; deals with #175, jacopo-chevallard/BEAGLE-general#47 and jacopo-chevallard/BEAGLE-general#49
- Fixing two bugs - one from incorrect merge choice, on present in AGN branch  The change to io_nebular_emission.f90 was an incorrect merge choice so I would need to implement this change in the actual merge correctly. The change to galaxy_SED should be made in agn before merge. agn_luminosity is only allocated if ‘agn_lacc’ parameter present in file, so if it’s not present, this line causes a seg-fault
- Merge branch agn_temp into master_temp - in actual branches will comment out compilation of testing routines inCMakeLists.txt
