title: "0.6.1"
category: New Release

- Changed Shippable file to trigger build for tags: remember, tags do not belong to any branch, so if you restrict your build (with the only option) to master, tags are not built, hence Docker is not triggered
- First attempt to use FPL to improve/ease the command line options passed to Beagle
