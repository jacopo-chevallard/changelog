title: "0.10.3"
category: New Release
---
- removed check on max_stellar_age < current_sfr_timescale
- again on IO stellar [debug needed]
- More on Temporary version: I/O HIInebular fits files [not fully implemented]
- Temporary version: I/O HIInebular fits files [not fully implemented]
- A param file to be used with test_composite_AGN_SF_compute_SED
- added test that starts to build composite SED  Everything is initialized so that one can start as if they are in compute_SED.
- initialise AGN templates  edited iotemplates so that if ‘AGN TEMPLATES’ is written into the parameter file then the templates are read in within initialize_templates
- Added luminoisty distance in the output FITS file, partially dealing with #101
- more on testing read in of AGN nebular
- Changed default value of SFR to 1, since when adopting constant SFR the user can choose to provide the final mass and not a value for the SFR, in which case using the default value of -99 doesn't make sense
- Added NIRCam filters
