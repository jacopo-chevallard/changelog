- The number of LyC photons is now always computed directly from the SED, since interpolating the LyC photons tables of the *ineb files means ignoring any photon emitted by stars older than 10^7 yr
- Make Begale gracefully exiting when all photometric objects are fitted, to avoid confusing error messages (e.g. see jacopo-chevallard/BEAGLE-general#69)
- Added to the Beagle output the monochromatic UV luminosity at 1500 AA, using the three definitions that we adopted for xi_ion
