title: "0.10.1"
category: New Release

- Ages are now added to the SFH time step, instead of replacing the nearest value already present (meaning that the size of the time_step array can vary); introduced a check of validity for the SFH for the cases in which the mass formed in the smooth component is 0 (because of the values of the current_sfr_timescale, max_stellar_age, and type of SFH adopted)
- Changed allocation of number of time steps, which must be equal to the number of time steps in the SF_ChE and not in the input template SSPs (sometimes these are equal, in other cases they are not)
- Introduced a new parameter check: max_stellar_age must be > current_sfr_timescale to have a valid SFH
- new modules for the galactic_HII and agn_nlr nebular emission
- more on testing
- temporary test of the nebular emission
- still on merging AGN(preliminary)-BEAGLE
