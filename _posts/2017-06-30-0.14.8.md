title: "0.14.8"
category: New Release
---
- Updated MCFOR dependency version
- Version bump 0.14.8
- Added command line option to specify number of calls to the likelihood function when testing the execution speed; added profiling statistics using szaghi's FITTER package
- Added some calls for profiling; refactoring to avoid multiple memory allocations/dellocations of arrays which have always the same size
- Added some profiling calls to get time spent in different parts of the code
- Refactoring to use loop instead of spread, as it is more easily optimized by compilers
- Refactoring to avoid multiple, useless calls to 'contains_substring' routine, and to make it more readable
- Using two instances of 'class_interpolation', one for the continuum, one for the lines, as this allows a better optimization of the methods within the 'class_interpolation' (for instance the memory allocation)
- Passing the FITS extension name, so that, in the future, it will be easier to allow the user to pass the extension name via the parameter file
- Removed modules implementing the older API for filters/photometry
- Removed dependence from older filters API; fixed merge conflict
- Removed unused functions/variables which were still depending on the older filters/photometry APIs (on the 'type_photometry' module)
- Corrected typos which were likely introduced during rebasing (how???)
- Added 'current_sfr_timescale' parameter to the 'STAR FORMATION' extension
- Cleaned unused modules
- Added expansion of env variables when reading filters; cleaned unused modules
- Passing flag for coverage
- No more explicitly passing Fortran compiler
- Updated names of input files
- Added example files necessary to test/use the new classes
- Added unit test for PhotFilter class
- Removed last uses of 'f_mean' function (based on BC routines) in favour of the new 'PhotFilter' class
- Turned subroutine into function
- Corrected use of new API for 'compute_SED' routine
- Removed unused dummy variable
- Added manual compilation of some tests
- Updated test module
- Updated modules to reflect adoption of new classes
- Removed unused dependence
- Added shared 'collector' (which, in the future, will be the main Beagle class)
- Changed some subroutines to functions; added I/O
- Updated constructor to reflect changes to base abstract class
- Removed spurious print statements
- Added support for 'SpectrumClass' class; added method 'isInitialized'
- Updated module to use the new 'SpectrumClass'
- Turned the class into an abstract class; added support for 1D quantities
- Updated module to use the new 'SpectrumClass'
- Updated module to use new classes for photometry I/O
- Updated module to use the new 'SpectrumClass'
- Removed old 'photometry' module, which has been replaced by more modern classes
- Updated module to adopt the newly available 'SpectrumClass' and 'PhotBandList' classes
- Updated module to adopt the newly available 'SpectrumClass'
- Removed type and routines which are now included in the 'SpectrumClassMod' class
- Added base class for spectra
- Added class which will act as a container for all other classes used in Beagle (this will help us in having to re-write the APIs of many functions each time a new class is added)
- Removed dependence from older 'photometric_object' and 'photometric_catalogue' types
- Changed the 'PhotBand' class to EXTEND(PhysicalQuantity)
- Started inclusion of new classes 'PhotCatalogue', 'PhotFilterList', and 'ClassCollector'
- Changed default units for photometry to [Jy]
- Added %isLoaded and %isInitialized methods
