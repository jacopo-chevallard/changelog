- Bug fix: reading of stellar and nebular templates was not working well, since the stellar SEDs were reset to 0 at every cycle of nebular templates read. Also the interpolation of the stellar SED on the same wl array of nebular SED wasnot correct. This bug, however, was only affecting the computation of some derived quantities, not the fitting itself.
