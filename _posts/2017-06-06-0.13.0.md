title: "0.13.0"
category: New Release
---
- Merge pull request #186 from feltre/master  AGN module integration
- Added new class for 'PhysicalParameter' which we should use for all the (adjustable) physical parameters in Beagle
- Added temporary debug lines
- Implemented possibility of having a different 'max_stellar_age' in each star formation period: this allows greater flexibility in the parametrization of the SFH of galaxies
- Added dependent parameter: fixing metallicity of second star formation period equal to metallicity of first star formation period
- Renamed parameter indicating stellar mass formed in a star formation period from 'mass-bin-' to 'mass-'; added 'max_stellar_age' parameter for each star formation period
- Bug fix: extinction curves (MW, SMC, LMC) were not correctly computed when the 'attenuate' function was called twice, for the entire SED and emission lines; reduced code duplication by having the Calzetti curve computed in the same routine as the extinction curves; avoid interpolating extinction/Calzetti curve at each call by passing the interpolated curve to the 'attenuate' function.
- commenting plot statement
- replacing cmake/BEAGLE_meta_info files that were deleted at some point in the AGN development
- implementing linewidth fix to address issue #176
- removing print statements used for testing as well as file originally used for testing
- Commenting out nebular emission tests in CMakeLists.txt
- Merge branch 'agn'
- Improved debug mode: the parameters and likelihood value of the model which is plotted are printed to stdout
- Corrected the behaviour of the LSF convolutions in some limiting cases: the input FWHM is < templates FWHM, but the mean of the Gaussian LSF is > 0: in this case you should only check whether the shift is large engough to move the model SED by one spectral bin; the difference bwteeen the input and model FWHM is very small, so that, in practice, you fall back to the previous case, i.e. you convolve with a Dirac delta function
- more on param file for testing
- plot and file for testing BEAGLE
- Fixing two bugs - one from incorrect merge choice, on present in AGN branch  The change to io_nebular_emission.f90 was an incorrect merge choice so I would need to implement this change in the actual merge correctly. The change to galaxy_SED should be made in agn before merge. agn_luminosity is only allocated if ‘agn_lacc’ parameter present in file, so if it’s not present, this line causes a seg-fault
- merging agn branch with master at v0.11.1
- Default values for the nebular emission parameters (logU, xi_d, Z_ISM, C/O) are now automatically set depending on the templates read
- Updated function that returns log(O/H) values to correclty deal with models with variable C/O
- Using fypp pre-process to minimize potential errors when needing the same function/routine to work with different types: with pre-processing we write the routine only once, then fypp will replicate it for different types
- Added fypp pre-processing
- Corrected wrong output (problem of mixing double/single ticks)
- Removed spurious print
- Added new adjustable parameter, nebular C/O
- Added dimension C/O in interpolation
- Updated routines to account for increased dimension of nebular template type; correctly account for variable FWHM in templates
- Added I/O capability for nebular emission models with variable C/O
- Modified type to allow for variable C/O, i.e. we increased the dimension of the arrays containing the template fluxes
- Modified LSF convolution to correctly account for the variable FWHM of the templates
- more on param file for testing
- plot and file for testing BEAGLE
