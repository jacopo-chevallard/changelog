title: "0.19.0"
category: New Release
---
  - Merge branch 'feature/split_line_continuum' into develop

  - Corrected few bugs which prevented the continuum-only SEDs to be correctly computed

  - Corrected printing of emission lines to output FITS file

  - Corrected bug: emission lines are correctly passed also in the absence of dust attenuation

  - Corrected last bugs for line / continuum splitting

  - Added 'CONTINUUM SED' to output FITS file

  - Added new PRINT keywords for the emission lines and continuum splitting

  - Modified print routine to use the 'print' token that the user can set (in prev version all lines were printed no matter the 'print' flag)

  - Corrected printing of line fluxes to FITS file

  - Replaced character '@' with '_' in the column names, as '@' is not correctly read by some FITS readers (e.g. TOPCAT)

  - Started implementing separation between line and continuum emission

  - Added line flux to the output. This is the quantity that can be used in combination with the continuum to separately analyze lines and continuum emission

  - Added class attributes to hold continuum luminosity and flux

  - Added time-dependent quantities
