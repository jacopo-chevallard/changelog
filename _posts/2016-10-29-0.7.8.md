title: "0.7.8"
category: New Release
---
- Version bump 0.7.8
- Changed sign of EW to revert to version <= 0.7.6: EW of emission lines are positive, EW of absorptions negative. Updated the manual as well to explicitly state this.
- We reset the observation data type to its default values at the beginning of each cycle, to prevent information pertaining to a previous object to be used in successive fittings
- Changed intent of derived type: intent(out) would reset the type to its default values, which is not what we want
