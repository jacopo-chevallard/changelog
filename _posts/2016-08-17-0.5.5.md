title: "0.5.5"
category: New Release
---
- Moved the additions of parameters for spectrosopic flux calibration correction to the instrumental_effects module
- In the presence of a combined spectro-photometric fitting, the observed and model spectrum are normalized in the same region, so that the information of the absolute flux calibration of the observation is only carried by photometric data
- Major change in the way the multiplicative polynomial is handled
- Adopted same approach as in MCFOR and ASTROFORTRAN to account for dependencies
