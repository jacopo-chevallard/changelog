  - Initializing the templates to 0

  - Bug fix: the splitting of line and continuum emission (ver 0.19.0) broke the use of pure stellar templates, which is now fixed

  - Enabled fitting of spectroscopic redshifts, i.e. fitted spectra can be provided without a redshift, in which case the redshiftis determined during the fitting

  - Removed the 'select_likelihood_spectral_region' function and its usage, since now we are correclty treating the model convolution (accounting for the variable resolution of the templates) directly in the 'convolve_templates_losvd' procedure

  - Updated modules which use the 'get_templates_fwhm' function, to correctly deal with the return value -1

  - Updated the 'get_templates_fwhm' function, which now returns -1 for templates regions fir which the resolution is not defined

  - Refactored to use FYPP preprocessor; changed LOSVD routines to use the information on the templates resolution instead of using the wl sampling
