title: "0.1.0"
category: New Release
---
- Merge branch 'develop' of https://github.com/jacopo-chevallard/BEAGLE into develop
- Merge tag '0.1.0' into develop  First beta-release, 0.1.0
- Merge branch 'release/0.1.0'  First beta release of BEAGLE tool.
- Merge tag '0.1.1' into develop  Test
- Merge branch 'hotfix/0.1.1'
- Testing...
- Merge pull request #52 from eclake/master  Chemical abundance resampling
- Merge tag '0.1.0' into develop  testing the first tagged release
- Merge branch 'release/0.1.0'
- Test
- Made the "photometry" data types consistent with the "spectral indices" ones  We also removed the option to use ASCII catalogue for photometric data
- Refactoring to better differentiate "primitive" data types from higher level types
- Merge branch 'develop' of https://github.com/jacopo-chevallard/BEAGLE into develop
- Updated example param file
- Test function for the chemical abundance resampling  With associated changes to CMakeLists.txt Currently hard-coded to require files from ECL's laptop.
- Resampling of chem_abund in get_simulated_SF_ChE  The resampling ensures that the rate of change in the chemical abundance matches the rate of change in the mass.  This should work for arbitrary forms of sfr law within bins.  BUT - is not reliable in this commit - it requires the storage of bin edges as well as bin centres and so will work in future commits!
- Corrected syntax error
- Code refactoring: 'BANGS' ---> 'BEAGLE'
- Updated CMake to reflect change in astrofortran libraries, should fix #45
- Removed the ramaining 'call system' calls
- Corrected bug in *4color reading
- Small update to reflect change in astrofortran
- read_semi_analytic_sfh now reads in redshift steps and calculates time_step and formation_age internally to ensure consistency  Redshift step is no also saved in simulated_SF_ChE_data
- Fix for github issue #41  BEAGLE was crashing if an ineb file not supplied as it was still trying to compute nebular line EWs.
- Integrated new changes to allow fitting data with external prior on redshift, closes #2
- Added function to change a parameter prior
- Added function to load a catalogue of 'priors'
- Added message to print ID of fitted object
- Added variables to contain mean and sigma for redshift prior
- Added possibility to read column containing priors for the model parameters
- Number of LyC photons correctly computed for nebular emission models
- Updated filters list to include EUCLID filters
- all variables required in previous commit now explicitly declared  referring to changes made to get_simulated_SF_ChE
- Fixed rebinning of chemical abundance of simulated sfh chem_abund  The rebinning of the chemical abundance needs to scale with the change in mass but this is not the same as chem_abund per unit mass multiplied by mass in ssp time step (previous implementation).  Now the chem_abund changes at the same rate as the change in mass, based on the start and end points of chem_abund within each bin that has to be resampled.
- Added spectral indices contribution to likelihood computation
- Added loading of catalogue containing spectral indices
- Added EW computation
- New module
- ...
- Added initialisations for spectral indices
- added new modules
- Added printing in the output of the indices used in the likelihood calculations
- Updated data type "use" from modules
- Moved data type to independent module
- Removed line indices information from the photometry module
- Updated data types "use" from the corresponding modules
- Additions and updating of data types
- Out data type in a separate module; put computation of spectral indices in a separate module
- Two changes  Renamed FITS extension in which Lick spectral indices are saved. Put data type containing LOSVD in a different module
- Added function to get number of rows from FITS table
