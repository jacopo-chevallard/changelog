title: "0.16.1"
category: New Release
---
- Changed command to launch Beagle to avoid errors
- Changed call to 'locate' function, since it was not adapted when having a LSF which varies with lambda
- We are now resampling the spectrum and then applying the LSF
- Added possibility to read LSF dispersion from FITS file containing the spectrum; added parameter to scale the LSF dispersion read from the input spectrum
- Using 'luminosity_distance' to set the luminosity distance (instead of redshift); introduced check on wl range covered by models to compute or not quantities requiring the UV magnitude at 1500 ang
- Added marginal spectrum to 'spectrum_data_sp' type and use of marginal spectrum in the output
- Introduced possibility to read the LSF parameters from the input spectrum itself. For instance, SDSS spectra include the instrumental dispersions (sigma_lsf) for each pixel of the spectrum
- Corrected bin number parsing; changed parameter name for luminosity distance, 'distance' ----> 'luminosity_distance'
- Added method to check class initialization
