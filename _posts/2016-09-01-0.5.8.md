- MAJOR BUG: the emission line flux was wrongly spread onto the wl bins. As a consequence, the flux in the emission lines (in the galaxy SED) was overestimated by a factor 1.5014, and this was evident when computing EW of emission lines for very young ages, and when comparing the flux integrated from the SED with the luminosity of the lines.
