title: "0.10.5"
category: New Release
---
- Added token for user-provided LSF
- Minor refactoring
- Version bump 0.19.9
- Avoid useless calculation if no redshift is provided
- Added feature: the 'priors catalogue' can now be used in combination with full spectra, even in absence of photometry
- Version bump 0.19.8
- Added A_B and A_V to Beagle output ('DUST ATTENUATION' extension), closes jacopo-chevallard/BEAGLE-general#62
- Added computation of B- and V-band attenuation optical depths, A_B and A_V
- Version bump 0.19.7
- Corrected 'malloc' crash, which was caused by the use of an allocatable string to get a SF bin from its name
- Added variables containing the naming of the star formation bins ('bin') and the separator ('-') for the bin numbering
- Improved error handling
- Version bump 0.19.6
- Added to the output FITS file (in the 'POSTERIOR PDF' extension) the chi-square and number of data points used (this latter quantity is a proxy for the number of degrees of freedom). Fixes jacopo-chevallard/BEAGLE-general#75
- Implemented computation of chi-square in the likelihood function, so that chi-square can be used as a goodness-of-fit measure
- Version bump 0.19.5
- Checkign whether the LSF is set, not just initialized, before applying it
- Bug fix: the LSF was applied to the model spectrum also dividing by the width of the spectral bins, causing a wrong normalization of the speectrum; Legendre polynomial are now used instead of normal polynomials to describe the variation of the LSF width and center with lambda; added the 'lsf_units' parameter to define whether the LSF is epxressed as a FWHM or as sigma
- Bug fix: the 'bin_number' extracted from the parameter names (e.g. param_name-1) included the '-' character, which was interpreted as a minus sign when covnerting it into an index; 'lsf_type' is now set, along with 'lsf_units', in the 'initialize_lsf_parameters' procedure
- Renamed 'sigma' --> 'width', since the width of the LSF can be expressed in both km/s (sigma) and angstrom (FWHM); added 'units' field to the 'lsf_data' data type
- Updated astrofortran dependency, needed to access the 'legendre_poly' function
- Version bump 0.19.4
- Initializing the templates to 0
- Bug fix: the splitting of line and continuum emission (ver 0.19.0) broke the use of pure stellar templates, which is now fixed
- Enabled fitting of spectroscopic redshifts, i.e. fitted spectra can be provided without a redshift, in which case the redshiftis determined during the fitting
- Removed the 'select_likelihood_spectral_region' function and its usage, since now we are correclty treating the model convolution (accounting for the variable resolution of the templates) directly in the 'convolve_templates_losvd' procedure
- Updated modules which use the 'get_templates_fwhm' function, to correctly deal with the return value -1
- Updated the 'get_templates_fwhm' function, which now returns -1 for templates regions fir which the resolution is not defined
- Refactored to use FYPP preprocessor; changed LOSVD routines to use the information on the templates resolution instead of using the wl sampling
- Version bump 0.19.3
- Bug fix: overridden procedrues must be public
- Version bump 0.19.2
- Updated dependencies versions
- Added procedure to print the properties of photometric filters
- Made these two classes compatible with the new definition of the 'PhysicalQuantityMod' class
- Deferred procedures must be public, otherwise you get compilation errors with Intel Fortran; completed the 'setValue1d' procedure
- Simplified addition of nested dependencies
- Version bump 0.19.1
- Added explicit array allocation, to avoid crashes with ifort 16.0.8
- Removed incorrect allocatable attribute which was making Beagle crash with Intel Fortran ifort 16.0.8
- Version bump 0.19.0
- Merge branch 'feature/split_line_continuum' into develop  Added new functionality: ability to have separately in the output file the line and continuum emission
- Corrected few bugs which prevented the continuum-only SEDs to be correctly computed
- Corrected printing of emission lines to output FITS file
- Corrected bug: emission lines are correctly passed also in the absence of dust attenuation
- Corrected last bugs for line / continuum splitting
- Added 'CONTINUUM SED' to output FITS file
- Added new PRINT keywords for the emission lines and continuum splitting
- Modified print routine to use the 'print' token that the user can set (in prev version all lines were printed no matter the 'print' flag)
- Corrected printing of line fluxes to FITS file
